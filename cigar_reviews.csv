12,Mr. Robot Fumador by Mr. Robot Cigars Aged 1 Year,"Wrapper: Undisclosed Binder: Undisclosed Filler: UndisclosedThis excites me. There is a very well-known brand in our industry with a very well-known blender behind it and he wants anonymity. After you are in this business for a while, you hear it all. They used to be good. Their new line is just okay. That guy got lucky. So on, and so forth. So, we have been sworn to secrecy and are happy to oblige. This is the chance for said blender to see if he is resting on his laurels, or if he is as good as he thinks he is. I will give no more information other than that. I have to say the style of art is totally different from what you may expect from the original blend. The brand was named or inspired by one of my favorite shows, Mr. Robot. Great show! So, if you love it, shout out @mrrobotcigars and let them know if they are onto something with this! #weareprivada",Michael Nevins,verified owner,"July 6, 2021",This stick is amazing!!!

13,Yellow Bird by Aladino Aged 7 Months,"Wrapper: Honduran Habano Binder: Corojo Honduran Filler: Corojo HonduranWell, folks, I can retire after this one. An exclusive from Aladino? Let me refresh you. This family built and sold Camacho to Davidoff before Davidoff turned the brand into a mass production shop. The cigars have since lost their identity. This is what those cigars would have tasted like before, however, the Eiroa family that grows the tobacco thinks this new crop is even better. Why? Science. End of story. This is the true original Corojo leaf from Cuba before they had to hybridize their seeds in Cuba. Some people say this is the best Corojo in the world. I know, I sound like a broken record, but it is all worth noting. This is most likely the final cigar in our excursion down the street that some of us grew up on. I love the double bands and the artwork, shout out to @sedatedhype for the art! Justo Eiroa, son of Junto Eiroa the founder of Aladino, and the who’s who of Honduran Tobacco wants you to know that this is his family’s best tobacco and something he is extremely proud to share with you all. Let’s also remember @jretobacco (parent company) on Instagram when posting this amazing cigar. Like it, love it, or not, this is the pinnacle of new world cigar tobacco and something to be appreciated and grateful to smoke. #weareprivada",Brandon Baize,verified owner,"June 29, 2021","My oh my. What can I say. Thick wrapper, full of amazing tobacco. This thing is packed with rich rich flavor. It’s got alot going on. Spicy cedar, smoky peanuts, licorice, sweet aged tobacco.

19,Back To The Future Part 4,"Welcome to our 4th installment of what we lovingly call our B2F series. This is a series where we find cigars from over 5 years ago, in this case, 8 years aged and compare them with their current-day counterparts. This installment is extremely rare and deserves to be experienced by cigar heads who are truly curious about how cigars age and what it does to the flavors of a cigar. In this case, we have a real treat. In 2012 The Eiroa family sold their beloved Camacho factory to Oettinger Davidoff. The Eiroas have one of the most sought-after Corojo Cuban seed tobacco known to man. Let me explain why it is so special. For starters, this is the original Cuban Corojo seed. Cuba saw waves of blue mold that destroyed their Corojo and lead them to hybridize their Corojo Seed to what it is today. The Eiroas have the original. 2. The Eiroa work with Bayer Crop Science. They know everything from weather patterns to soil PH levels as well as what to give the plants and when. One may argue the Erioas have the best tobacco in the world. After the sale of Camacho in 2012 the family had to wait it out a few years for a non-compete to expire. So we have a 2012 Corojo Camacho ToroA Cle Plus current day toroAnd an Aladino Corojo Toro current day",Toke Masta,verified owner,"July 12, 2021",Man….. all three of these cigars were 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Especially that damn Aladino. Gives you big Cuban cigar feels! #PSSITA #TokeMasta,5
20,Twin Pines by Jochy Blanco,"Tasting Notes: Sweet, piney and fruity on the body. Apricot and wood on foot. Cinnamon raisin bread on the cold draw. Smooth creamy woody/piney and citrusy zing kick this thing off. Bitter espresso and pine, cedar and floral notes along with some natural root-like herbal notes. The retro is dark, cedary, and floral with slight red pepper. Cedar, oak, flowers, white pepper and oily smoke emblazon the palate with fuller pepper and dried fruits on the retrohale. The second third is creamier. There is a butter richness, floral notes, cedar and an oily smoke with hints of sarsaparilla. The retrohale is sugary and floral. Around the halfway point, cinnamon enters the mix. Cinnamon, sarsaparilla root, flowers and white pepper along with slight almonds and vanilla caress the senses and make this a dream to smoke. The sensation is a bit effervescent, like soda. In the final third I get florals, cinnamon, sarsaparilla root and powdery smoke. The retro is oaky and smooth with hints of spices. Towards the end the flavors all meld together to bring this thing to a climax! WOW! Pairing Notes: RC Cola. Scotch from the Highlands. Vanilla anything. Hennessy XO or VSOP. After Thai food. Lager. Chilled white wine. Jack Daniels. Vanilla pudding. Cream filled caramels. Medium roast coffee.",Jeff Mckissick,verified owner,"July 8, 2021",Seriously?!

21,Aganorsa Leaf Wavy Wafer Aged 10 Months,"Tasting Notes: The body is barnyard, cotton candy, and floral notes. The foot is Hershey’s chocolate syrup and hazelnut. The cold draw is hay, roasted hazelnut, and chocolate syrup. The first third starts with chocolate syrup, waffle cone, vanilla wafer, red pepper, charred cedar, and florals like hibiscus and cherry blossom. Further in, I get red pepper, cherry coke, chocolate syrup, vanilla, herbs, chocolate syrup, and black pepper on the retro. In the second third, I get more cedar, vanilla, cocoa, shea butter creaminess, and that ice cream cone thing comes back. The pepper has died down. In the final third, I get cola, herbs, salt, earth, white pepper, and vanilla sweetness that comes back at the very end along with hints of cocoa. WOW. WOW. WOW.Pairing Notes: Vanilla ice cream cone.

45,Blanco No. 9 Aged 11 Months,"Tasting Notes: Natural tobacco and faint apple cider vinegar on the body. The foot has similar notes. Not much on the cold draw. The first third is licorice, charred oak, vanilla, white pepper, creamy smoke, earthiness, and a geranium floral. There’s also a sandalwood kind of thing coming through. The smoke is sweet and woody with minerals and salt.

47,Blanco No. 5 Aged 11 Months,"Tasting Notes: On the body, I get sweet hay, cocoa butter, and a little bit of a faint vinegar note. On the foot, I get rich tobacco. On the cold draw, I get rich tobacco and something that reminds me of bread with flour and sugar, like a sourdough yeast kind of thing and a nice floral note. In the first third, I get floral, sesame seed, and wheat toast that’s buttered. The florals are violet purple and there’s a nice white pepper on the tongue with some minerals. Further in I get heavy florals, a nice cedar, a sesame seed oil kind of flavor, and buttered wheat toast along with minerals and salt. In the second third, I get floral, cedar and toast. The white pepper really kicked things up a notch, bordering on cinnamon and making a big difference. The smoke also got creamier and the cedar ramped up. The retrohale is a good amount of white pepper and cedar. The florals are even stronger now and the white pepper has truly become cinnamon. Heavy florals, buttered wheat toast, cedar, and cinnamon along with a good amount of mineral essence. In the final third, I get purple floral notes, toast, cedar, cream, and once again, white pepper. In the very end, I get cocoa notes as well.Pairing Notes: After breakfast. Buttered toast. Dried fruits. Cognac. Aged rum. Belgium beers. One hour after anything cinnamon. Light roast coffee.

The #9 is great and equally well made and performing and to be honest I enjoy it even more than the his original NINE which is saying a lot… Over my 20 years of smoking I have a handful of ‘first time smoking a cigar experiences’ for which i will never forgot where i was, what i was doing, whom i was with and the pleasure of that particular cigar…. and the #5 is now in that grouping… Well done Dave.. i hope this blend remains available",5
48,Mad Monkey Limited Edition,"There once was a baby monkey in the jungles of Thailand. Now this area had a history of low-level Mafia members going into the jungles to steal these monkeys. They took them back to the city centers and trained them how to smoke cigarettes and beg for change from tourists. One day on vacation, probably to do some very illegal things in countries where they are legal, a circus operator saw a very special monkey. What made this monkey so special to the circus operator was the fact that he smoked cigars. You see, this monkey truly enjoyed cigars. The monkey would hang out outside of cigar shops and steal people’s cigars, half smoked, from their ashtrays. No one seemed to mind, and everyone got a kick out of it. Some of the tourists even gave the monkey cash tips. The monkey was very happy in Thailand. So back to our circus operator who loved the cigar smoking monkey. The circus operator had the monkey stolen. He was monkey-napped!Thrown into a very small cage and put on a plane headed for North America, the monkey traveled all of the Americas from Canada through Mexico and even into Central America performing for circus goers. One fine evening in Bakersfield, California the monkey was performing for some of the circus patrons. He saw a cigar in an ashtray and got excited. He pulled his usual cigar-stealing trick and started smoking. The monkey did not realize that this cigar was very special. It was not only a marijuana-laced cigar, but a few of the leaves were dipped in PCP a.k.a. angel dust.The monkey went mad that night, never to be quite the same again. The monkey exploded into a fit of rage. He broke everything in sight, broke into trailers, threw things around, shit in his hand and threw it at the circus leader’s face. Upon being subordinated by the circus staff, the monkey ran for the outskirts of the circus into a wooded area never to be seen again by the circus clowns nor the leader of the circus himself.Two days later the monkey came to consciousness in the sand dunes in the deserts of Southern California. After almost dying of exhaustion and heat stroke, he made his way to a very small desert town on the border of California and Arizona. He found a source of water, a leaky hose behind the gas station. When one of the employees on a smoke break opened the back door, the monkey snuck in and hid in the cooler. That night the monkey feasted like he’s never feasted before. He also raided the gas station’s humidor stealing hundreds of dollars worth of cigars.Since that fateful afternoon, this monkey, now infamous and referred to as the Mad Monkey runs the streets of the United States and Mexico, stealing from convenience stores and cigar shops at night. It is rumored that the monkey once made his way into Juarez, where a cartel leader took a shining to him. The cartel enjoyed watching the monkey smoke cigars and steal things. Until one night, after a drunken, cocaine-fueled binge, the cartel members passed out leaving their assault rifles and gold out in the open. Legend has it, our Mad Monkey shot the cartel leader in the leg, leaving him with a permanent limp. The monkey was never seen again, however there have been reports all over the southwest and the southeast, mainly in Texas, of brick and mortar cigar shops being robbed of small amounts of inventory. No one knows whether the monkey is alive or dead, but one thing is for certain. The Mad Monkey loves cigars.",John Shea,verified owner,"April 3, 2021",Great stuff!,5

71,Capo Habano by Capo Cigars Aged 1 Year,"Tasting Notes: The body has a pungent lemon oil scent with an almost chemical smell like I have smelled before in manufactured furniture. Very unique. I know this cigar is completely natural, so I am very intrigued by this. The foot is lemon oil and slight cedar. The draw tastes like lemon iced tea with notes of dried oregano. Dry oak, salt, baked bread, heavy white pepper retro, and buttery smoke are the start of something special with this one. I get notes of lightly burned butter which I love, along with herbs and dried flowers or some type of floral. Earthy, herby, buttery, minerally, salty with white pepper and dried floral notes enveloping the palate. Further in, I get hints of lemongrass and a slate-like finish with notes of honey as well. And then begin some notes of bread, oak, cinnamon, and butter. We are off to a great start. The second third begins buttery with florals and oaky smoke along with a mineral finish and salty zing. I’m reminded of sunflower seeds. Sweet florals, oak, butter, salt, and a hint of anise every now and then. Some vanilla too. In the final third I get vanilla, oak, florals, slight salt, and a phantom grapefruit note along with wood and minerals. The floral smells remind me a little of marijuana or a pungent flower of some sort. The grapefruit and vanilla mixed with the oak make this thing a superb and unique smoke!Pairing Notes: Amber or lager beer. Cognac. Honey. Bourbon. Cream soda. Cinnamon anything. Orange tea with honey. Toast with butter and coffee with cream and sugar, medium roast. Anything herby like herb-crusted bread or herb butter. Rye whiskey.

I think the description listed is spot on. Lots of good smoke, peppery with fruits, changing complexion about 1/2 way through. Peppery taste tends to soften a little on the 2nd half. Construction could’ve been better. I ordered two of these sticks and they arrived quickly and superbly packaged, so dryness wasn’t an issue. Wrapper was noticeably unraveling in one spot below the band, which cause the “crack” (sound) during smoking however, the taste remained good throughout. I’d purchase again.

80,EPC Encore 2017 Aged 3+ Years (The Original Cigar Of The Year Batch),"The Valiente is a torpedo, the El Primero is not.Tasting Notes: The body is faint molasses and florals. The foot is raw, rich, red tobaccos. The cold draw is cedar, rich florals, and slight white pepper. In the beginning I am met with honey, oak florals, pepper and bread. The retrohale is so zingy without being abrasive. The smoke is buttery and rich. The finish is the show stopper here, it is cleaner than any other cigar I believe I’ve had. It’s getting herbaceous an inch in. Oak, bread, and black pepper are the main focus but there also remains a beautiful floral and retrohale that is out of this world. Rich tobacco is on my mind throughout this smoking experience. I’m noticing a vanilla note picking up. It mixes with the floral incredibly. Red rich tobacco, florals, and a zingy finish. This is an amazingly balanced cigar, yet aggressive where you want it to be. Second third starts out with oak and floral. There is a zing of salt and minerals. I’m getting phantom flavors of moss in some puffs. That red rich tobacco thing is still there and amazing. The butteriness is still there but it’s a little drier now. I get these citrus tingles on the finish and in some samples, I get citrusy notes off in the background. There is earth and moss at times again. Very unique. It’s smooth and rich, dark and earthy, yet it has the upper flavors of floral and that red rich tobacco. The herbs have picked up coming into the final third. Rich tobacco and slight vanilla are present, and while black pepper is my initial spice there is cinnamon on the finish heating the palate. Dried herbs, slight cocoa powder, unsweetened black pepper, and cinnamon. Finish with oak, slight bread, and red rich tobacco. I also get a cinnamon powder note on the retro. Oak comes back even heavier. The feeling of the mouth becomes cooling on the tongue in the end.Pairing Notes: Red wines. Aged cheddar. Cognac. Rye bourbon. Lowlands scotch. Pilsner beers. Red velvet cake or anything with a cream cheese icing. Butterscotch. Snickers bar. Cafe latte with cinnamon. Crumb cake.",matthew blackmon,verified owner,"March 4, 2021",My new favorite cigar.

82,Red Laugh Aged 6 years,"Tasting Notes: The body is dried peach and barnyard. The foot is natural tobacco, hay, and cocoa. The cold draw is more dried fruit and cayenne pepper. The first third starts with cocoa, black tea, floral, dank cedar, and red pepper. There are bitter chocolate and sweet creamy smoke. There is a fake banana note I get that makes me think of banana Laffy Taffy which plays into the name. Cocoa powder, sweet cream, minerals, and woods. There is also a very distinct black iced tea note I get throughout the cigar. I get notes of dried fruits, and herbs like rosemary and tea leaves. The second third starts out with dank cedar, black tea, white pepper, and creamy smoke. It’s beginning to get hard to pinpoint flavors because of this. They are melding together nicely and a lot faster than most cigars. We see some bread notes, like pumpernickel, peanuts, cedar, less dank than before with hints of cocoa, dried currants, and raisins. In the final third, the retrohale becomes a bit ashy. The berry flavors keep changing. The finish is now leaving pepper on my palate. The mouthfeel reminds me of warm apple pie and cinnamon. Prune, cedar, teas, and then a splash of vanilla thrown in from time to time make this thing a small killer! I also got charred woods in the end… what a well-balanced stick.Pairing Notes: Have black tea and honey an hour beforehand or with this cigar. Or have black iced tea.

98,Blackbird Idalia 108 Toro,"Tasting notes: I have to tell you it reminds me of a black leather belt I bought on the body. There is also some barnyard. The foot smells of wood and leather. The cold draw is almond, herbs, and leather. Man is that leather pronounced. Upon lighting I am met with leather, charred woods, and slight pepper. The retro is smooth yet spicy with slight black pepper. There are breads, cream, and cocoa, and the pepper exchanges black for red pepper every few puffs. There is earthiness and faint sweetness. Once we get going there is that luxurious leather we found on the body of the cigar with cream, earth pepper, and subtle vanilla. The cigar is really smooth at this point. If I’m being honest, it’s really hard to pull out each flavor individually. This element is known as balance. This cigar truly is balanced. Nothing is fighting with anything. It’s all there if you look for it, but it doesn’t flex in any one area. Chocolate, cream, dried herbs, spice, and breads are what I get most of in the 2nd third. In the final third I get some variation. I get this menthol cocoa thing at times, which I would describe as mint chocolate chip. It’s herbal and mineral-y.

99,Blackbird Idalia 108 Toro,"Tasting notes: I have to tell you it reminds me of a black leather belt I bought on the body. There is also some barnyard. The foot smells of wood and leather. The cold draw is almond, herbs, and leather. Man is that leather pronounced. Upon lighting I am met with leather, charred woods, and slight pepper. The retro is smooth yet spicy with slight black pepper. There are breads, cream, and cocoa, and the pepper exchanges black for red pepper every few puffs. There is earthiness and faint sweetness. Once we get going there is that luxurious leather we found on the body of the cigar with cream, earth pepper, and subtle vanilla. The cigar is really smooth at this point. If I’m being honest, it’s really hard to pull out each flavor individually. This element is known as balance. This cigar truly is balanced. Nothing is fighting with anything. It’s all there if you look for it, but it doesn’t flex in any one area. Chocolate, cream, dried herbs, spice, and breads are what I get most of in the 2nd third. In the final third I get some variation. I get this menthol cocoa thing at times, which I would describe as mint chocolate chip. It’s herbal and mineral-y.

I’m not in the club yet but saw this on his channel and thought I’d give it a try. I ordered two so I can give em a honest chance before I recommended it to my family and friends. First Cigar of the day and I only had a light lunch before pairing with a delicious doubleshot of espresso.To me the wrapper and foot smelled sweet, spicy, coffee with chocolate or cocoa and dried fruit and earthy. The draw was the same to me and I F’ing loved it from the first pull. As I continued to smoke the flavors matched the original smell but with some leather (used worn n’ weathered leather) and wood. I felt a sweeter note on the retro hale with a little spice. Reminded me of a dark chocolate and chili candy bar. To me, the flavor stayed consistent which was great with no issues on the pull. The beautiful cigar let me smoke her all the way to the band (that looks like it should be in a museum) before I needed to roll the ash off to remove the band.Nothing else to say other than Fantastic and I already purchased more.",5

146,HVC 500 Limited Edition Short Robusto PCC Exclusive,"Privada Cigar Club ExclusiveI have to admit I feel like a boss for this one. According to some, this was the best or at least one of the best cigars of 2019. It won limited cigar of the year. It took home several positions in some of the top 25 lists as well. People went nuts over it. So when Reinier, the owner of HVC, asked if he could produce a short robust for the club, of course I said YES! If you have been in the club a while now you know about Reinier. He’s a Cuban born scientist turned cigar maker with the voice of a villain and a heart of gold. Truly the nicest person I’ve met in this business. He’s got a bunch of great cigars in his lineup. But this one? This one right here? This takes the cake. This cigar was developed to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Cuba. So it’s no wonder why this cigar is possibly the closest thing to a new world Cuban you could ever find. All the American smokers want this experience when they smoke a Cuban cigar. But most are left wanting more to say the least. It’s like a Cuban cigar on steroids. The draw ranges from good to firm but ironically the firmer draw samples I smoked were even more enjoyable. Not typical. Not for me at least. And this size? I mean if there is a top 3 list of sizes for me, the short robusto is on that list. It’s enough for a sitting but leaves you wanting more. It’s like a weekend getaway versus an entire vacation. Sometimes shorter is just better.  Also, the wrapper is extremely DELICATE!!! Only pull the band off when you absolutely have to.

174,Sinistro Islay,"This is truly a mystery cigar. The fine people at Sinistro were walking through the aging rooms of La Aurora one day when their Whatsapp alerted them to a message from me. “I need 1500 Lanceros. They have to be amazing and I need them now dammit!” One of the partners, James, immediately texted back “this is impossible bro,” but the other partner Coleman chimed in with “I got you covered big dog.”  They searched high and low until finally stumbling upon the dankest part of the cellar. In a dusty corner they unearthed a dark, toothy, lancero that had been there for 6 years. No one knew what to make of this cigar. The flavors were so unique and there were so few of them that no one had ever put them out. The people in the factory always talked about doing something with them but it just never happened.

177,French Collection Cardinal Richelieu,"Allow me to introduce you to Jochy Blanco. He’s one of the best tobacco growers in the world. José “Jochy” Arnaldo Blanco III is a fourth-generation tobacco grower, a second-generation cigar maker, and the CEO of Tabacalera Palma in the Dominican Republic. It’s in his blood. His great grandfather, Manuel Blanco Lozada, started growing tobacco when he emigrated from Spain to the Dominican Republic in the mid-1800s. In 1925, Jochy’s father, José Arnaldo Blanco II, founded Tabacalera Palma, which made him one of the country’s earliest cigar makers. @tabacalerapalma is their instagram handle. You want to talk about a legacy? The kind of thing all the other guys are trying to claim? This is the real deal. Jochy made the Good Morning/Uncle Paulie’s Deli for us. Jochy does have a brand called La Galera, but our relationship with this farm is going to bring out the best damn cigars they ever made. Jochy is allowing us to rummage through the cigars he makes and pick the winners. Take this French Collection for example. Jochy visits France from time to time to explore vineyards and 300-year-old churches. On a trip about 5 years ago he visited an art gallery, and noticed many Old Master painters focused on religious figures as their subject matter. He was intrigued and started to research these figures, mostly cardinals. He became inspired to make cigars named after a few of them, that would pair well with wines. Art inspiring art. His ode to France and its rich history of wine, art and culture. No one could understand the branding, so they decided against selling them as a line, but these cigars were so damn good Jochy didn’t mind taking up some space and aging them for his own stash. Luckily, Privada came along and started doing some digging. Jochy offered, we tried the sticks and immediately decided to take most of them. He accepted, and this is the cigar you have in your hands.

179,Young Tabacaleros Freshman Lancero,"Tasting notes: On the body I get faint toast, cedar, sweetness, and a tad of cocoa. One the foot a bit of leather. The cold draw is that of aged cedar, ground hazelnut, and dried oregano. The first puff is toasted cedar, graham crackers, vanilla, and espresso. Tons of graham cracker and slight bread notes alongside cedar, vanilla, and the best pepper retrohale. The smoke is fluffy and has an amazing sensation. Further in I get dried basil, each puff changes with graham, minerals, wood, creamy smoke, vanilla, salt, and some cinnamon on the palate and retro. DAMN!!! Even further I get florals at the halfway mark, like lavender and herbs. The smoke becomes more oily and the sharp cedar and cinnamon dominate. In the final third, I taste dried herbs, cedar, leather, slight lemon. It’s sweet, right, and woody. WOW, just WOW. I really love this cigar. Only a few of you were lucky enough to have this so I hope you enjoyed it. Pairing notes: graham cracker crusted cheesecake. Graham cracker crusted key lime pie. Bourbon. Eat fruit salad an hour before smoking. Try a good Hefeweizen beer. Chilled pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. After eating sushi or fish. Maybe fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. White chocolate nibbles. Shout these cats out @clecigars!!!",Fernando Leites,verified owner,"January 22, 2021",Nice mild stick. Nothing to go crazy about. Enjoyable.,3
180,Illusione Cigares Privé PCC Exclusive,"Tasting Notes: I get wood, clover honey and Granny Smith apple on the body. Dried fruits on the cold draw, reminds me of the old apple fruit roll ups! Nostalgic. On the foot, I get fresh-cut cedar and dried apple and apricot. Wow. First ruffle has dried apple, cedar and the nicest retrohale. There is slight pepper as well. Cinnamon, wood, and baked apples with a great texture smoke and a finish with the best zing to it! In the retrohale I get a charcoal and lime citrus. There are also tons of Aganorsa florals! Second third is more apple but now I get the charred woods and the creamy smoke with cinnamon and florals with that lovely zing on the finish…damn this is great! The retrohale is very peaty/smoky at this point. In the final third I get so much dried fruits and florals, it’s unreal. Creamy wood and spice on the finish. This thing is a TRUE masterpiece.  Pairing notes: Sumatra or medium-roast coffee. Wheat ale with orange slice (Blue Moon or UFO). Lowland Scotch. Jack Daniels. Spanish red wine. Apples and honey. Apple pie a la mode with vanilla ice cream. Whipped cream. I feel like eating sour gummies a few hours beforehand may bring out the tangy and fruity notes. After a meal of BBQ ribs. CHAMPAGNE.

They are made for and by a master. You must try these!!,Chris Miller,verified owner,"October 9, 2020","Wow. Let me say it again – WOW. Hold onto your butane boys and girls, this cigar will blow your mind. Cold draw – so sweet that I had to light it before I could describe it. I lit this baby slow and low because I knew it was a keeper. A nice little 30 degree guillotine slice across this torpedo head lead the draw and let me tell you it is an absolute pleasure from start to finish. And by finish I mean I smoked this goddam thing until I couldn’t hold it any more with tweezers. First third, no bullshit, sweet as homemade whipped cream, just a joy right off the bat. Immediate shotgun blast of flavour that screams honey, light cashew and bourbon. I had no idea a cigar could taste this good. Second third, way more sweetness, but with more body and flavor that lingers longer across the palate – tasting more bourbon than honey, but both are omnipresent. I could go on, but words don’t describe the flavors – I get everything from butterscotch & bourbon to Lucky Charms. Final third is a triumphant send off to bliss and honestly gave me a little bit of a high. I’d buy a thousand of these if I could. Get one and experience it for yourself.

209,Fake Cuban #190,IT is what it is.,Paul Cedeno,verified owner,"December 4, 2020","So when I bought these I got two of them and boy am I glad. The first one was a challenge with some burn issues and draw issues, nothing serious but enough to take away from the experience, overall it just felt like cigar management rather cigar enjoyment. The second however, was a serious banger. The draw was perfect, burn was perfect, aroma and flavor galore. There is fruit and floral, a little spice which grows and a nuttiness that also continues to grow. It is a BIG cigar that just grows and develops amazingly. I will say that the second one rested in my special humidor for around 4 months before I smoked it. Also (at Brian), no need to consider exchange. I truly believe that a bad one of these is far and few, and I will be buying more to have for those time I want such a large cigar!! Totally recommend!",4

Cedar notes are present throughout the entire 1st and 2nd third as well. Final third all the flavors mentioned ramp up. I don’t enjoy hot smoke and this one got a bit hot at the very end. However, still a 1.5 hr smoke, easily.Final thoughts: Buy them while they’re still available! If you enjoy medium/medium smoke with smooth retro thanks to perfectly aged tobacco look no further!

I touched on this with the white series but they use no chemicals, flavors or additives in their growing, fermenting, aging and rolling process. Organic and natural all the way. I was taken aback with the love you all showed these folks. So were they. That’s how we got this. I got a call from Mr. Mora, the owner of the brand and farm. He told me he had something he thinks I would like. He explained they had a red series cigar that was a choice blend of the farmers on his land. They even had their favorite vitola for the blend: the Corona. As Cuban as it gets, and one of my favorites vitolas as well. They first opened doors about 6 years ago after the first tobacco yield. They had no way of selling these at the time. Remember, these guys are big money players from Beverly Hills and this started as more of a fun passion project. Well the employees rolled thousands of these red coronas and aged them in the aging room. It was basically something to do to stay busy while having their private stash. For the next yield they did the same thing. The cigars have been resting in the aging room for 4.5 years or longer, waiting to be smoked. Now the company is finally selling their products to the public and it’s time to make room. For showing Montenegro so much kindness on Instagram, they made sure we had first dibs on them.

263,Southern Draw Connecticut Shade Privada Cigar Club 2020 Exclusive Aged 1 year,"Robert and Sharon Holt, diligently worked with AJ Fernandez to produce the cigar you are now holding. About 12 months ago to date this cigar was finished. Because Robert is such a perfectionist he wanted the cigar to rest. I walked into El Titan De Bronze one day and who greets me at the door? Robert Holt. A veteran of the armed forces, a proud American and one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Robert has a big presence. You can tell he has seen a lot in his time and that he is most likely the best version of himself he has ever been. He got into cigars working for Verizon in South and Central America where he installed cell towers. He would hang with locals which eventually got him into local rituals of smoking a cigar after dinner. From there he was hooked. From what I understand he had a lot of money in the market during the 2008 crash. This was not a fun time for anyone. When posed with the question of what the next chapter of his life would be he chose cigars. I think I can speak for most of us in saying Southern Draw is possibly the best addition to boutique cigars we have seen in the past few years. That’s what makes this so special. I asked them to make this for us about 15 months ago. I thought it was a long shot because they do not typically do this sort of thing but they love Privada members so much for all the social media love you give them, that they happily agreed. So here we are. Our own Southern Draw exclusive. Not too shabby! There are actually two different releases. We have about 4,000 of each. We are giving some members the Connecticut Shade and some members the Habano. Thankfully we have enough left over to put in the shop on our website.

266,Espinosa Silver Toro Event Only Cigar Aged 2 years,"Espinosa Silver Toro Event Only CigarAged 2 yearsThis was a cigar found at La Zona (the Espinosa Factory in Nicaragua). They had made an error in filler while creating the cigar. Espinosa used this as an event cigar at his Miami factory. You had to purchase this at the event. Perk of being a Privada member! Erik Espinosa. A mans man. True to his word and as real as they come. Espinosa has been in the cigar game for 21 years now. He started working for brands like Drew Estate. Eventually he started his own brand with Don Pepin himself. After a good run together, they parted ways. Now I smoked Espinosa back in 2014. I liked their stuff but never found myself reaching for it. Over the past year or so members have been emailing me saying Have to try Espinosa. Some have even sent me Espinosa cigars. After smoking several of the samples, I have to say, something must have changed because I don’t remember them being this damn good! I think all of us hear about how great Tatuaje was around 2013-2015. Well these cigars Espinosa is making now remind me of that time. There is something unique, a dynamic flavor that you cannot quite name, and that my friends is what makes a brand POP. All of the lines I have tried recently have been unique with their own flavor and at the same time consistent within the brand. I am now a fan of Espinosa. And that is before meeting the man! I put a post on Instagram to tag Espinosa if you want them to make an exclusive cigar for us and less than a week later, Erik Espinosa was at my home. Pretty amazing thing you all have created here.

EVERYONE who is anyone in fashion, film, tech, art, music or design wants to be in LA. Even iconic New Yorkers such as D-nice, Jay-Z and Casey Neistadt are switching teams and moving west. Now let me tell you about Mr. Jon Buscemi. Jon grew up in Long Island New York, skateboarding and listening to hip hop. He is a fellow sneaker collector. He HUSTLES HARD! And after a stint at being a stock broker, he decided it wasn’t for him and he ended up working as a creative in fashion and eyewear for some very iconic brands. He is Italian through and through, and incredibly down to earth and sweet. After building his name and network in the fashion world, he started his own sneaker company called BUSCEMI and became wildly successful. He, like the aforementioned, moved to Los Angeles a few years ago. After surveying the food scene, he decided LA is missing a good Italian NY style deli. He called his cousin Paulie in Queens and the rest is history. Bringing a modern take on the old school Italian deli, the pair created Uncle Paulie’s Deli.https://unclepauliesdeli.comA year later, the who’s who of LA’s non gluten intolerant movers and shakers often lunch at Uncle Paulie’s. Located in the heart of West Hollywood, this is a must eat spot when you visit the City of Angels. Check them out on YouTube for a sneak peak. As for the cigar…Oh Boy!! Ya gonna want to sit down for this. Grown, fermented, rolled and aged by the one and only Jochy Blanco. Jochy is a 4th generation tobacco farmer who owns Tobacalera Palma in the Dominican Republic.

",KEN ROBERTS,verified owner,"March 27, 2020","“Room 101 Ichiban Salamon 2015 Aged 5 years made exclusively for West Side Humidor in Kansas” HOLY COW!!! I don’t have “alien” taste buds, and I don’t speak “connoisseur,” like the online cigar reviewers do, but I actually smelled “bourbon barrel soaked oak” as described by Privada’s reviewer in their description of this cigar!!! But I only SMELLED it on the wrapper and when inhaling the unlit cigar through its foot. So I probably smoked it faster than I would have (it lasted 1.1 hours) because I wanted to get to the TASTE of that “bourbon barrel soaked oak” — it smelled heavenly!!! This is a gorgeous, beautifully constructed cigar. You do have to nurse it when first lit through the first two inches, however, but then it burns perfectly and just sits and waits patiently for you to pick it up again. The draw is perfect, the smoke is smooth and plentiful, but bitter and dry throughout. I found this to be a mild and dry cigar through the first half, then the strength picked up to medium-bodied (but the flavors never did). No “complexity” right down to the nub. It was all worth it, though, for my very first smell of “bourbon barrel soaked oak”!!! Who knows?! Maybe I’m slowly becoming a better reviewer . . . ?!

This cigar has been aging in the stock room at West Side Humidor for about 4 years now. It is an honor to smoke it. I wish I had one for every single member but there just are not enough left. You can find some extras in our shop on the Privada website while supplies last. ",Mark Jenkins,verified owner,"September 6, 2020",I am in no way an expert but this was a great stick. The packaging was nice and the look of it was very cool. I don’t have a great palate but this thing tasted like cinnamon and latte to me. Had to order a few more to give out to friends.,5

The price is just right and it’s ALOT of cigar. It’s a great size for the blend as well. Smooth, well blended flavors of wood, earth, cao cao (maybe even slight milk chocolate). The retrohale is just a tad spicy but nothing to make the eyes water and I dig it. This DEFINITELY pairs with a bourbon or Scotch.

On the foot more of the same but also a black tea.  The cold draw is the quintessential Davidoff musty earthy notes. Amazing. I feel like if Tom Ford made a cigar, this would be it. The first puffs are nought and baklava. Yea I said that lol. Almond, sugary, nutty desert like notes. The Davidoff Olor is very present causing the mustiness I keep mentioning. Toasted oats, barley, white pepper zing, honey, blast wood are some notes we receive. I get raw almonds, Mushroom earthiness, charred cedar and rice wine vendor further in. Around the midway there is a slightly burned toast note, some graham cracker, rice wine vinegar, tart candy and cashew. In the end it’s vanilla and charred woods. HOLY COW!!

328,HVC PCC Exclusive,"Tasting Notes: On the body I get a sour cheese and leather and on another sample I get more of a salted peanut. From the foot I get roasted fresh ground coffee and peanuts. The cold draw is roasted nuts, ground coffee and pepper. I get some toasted coconut note as well. Once lit, leather, cream, roasted peanuts and pepper come at me! Dried herbs are also in the mix. Woods, cream, more leather and an overall balance that is phenomenal! Espresso and peanuts are dominant. Further in there is still pepper, leather, herbs and some hint of tropical notes in a creamy delicious smoke. Further down I get roasted nuts, sharp cedar on the retrohale, toasted coconut along with leather and a white pepper zing. The cigar becomes more sweet like an agave syrup and coats the tongue. In the end I get agave syrup, white pepper, cream, dried thyme, leather and a citrus like tingle on my mouth and tongue. The last few puffs bring hints of vanilla and lemon. Exquisite.Pairing notes: Dark roast coffee, roasted nuts, goobers, mounds, smores, anything with graham crackers- simple graham crackers or graham cracker crusted pies, after any Asian cuisine, with champagne, Belgian beers, Islay scotch, Hennessy VSOP or after any hearty meal of Latin influence.

It took to the flame perfectly and immediately produced a slightly sweet, flowery taste. Plentiful smoke output with a sweet aftertaste right from the get-go. Mild black pepper on the retrohale. Slightly firm draw (which I prefer); and an even, razor-sharp burn. Developing a woodsy taste and aroma and approaching full-body intensity. Firm ash that flowers and falls off in nice solid chunks (see photo)! A sweeter woodsy taste and greater intensity arrive in the second third. This baby burns cool! The intensity backed off to medium and the smoke continued to produce a very smooth, sweet aftertaste. Cool, smooth, and tasty right to the toothpick!

330,Kuwait Diplomat,"Tasting notes: The body of this cigar smells like a Lipton tea bag. The foot has a similar herbal sweet note but there is the addition of chocolate and the scent makes me sneeze as the foot of a cigar often does. The cold draw is more of the same: Lipton tea, dried apricot not unlike a Cuban cigar. But unlike a Cuban, it’s also peppery on the mouth and lips. The cigar starts out with a red pepper blast. Fading in are notes of fresh baked bread crusts, herbal teas, floral notes and a clean crisp white pepper on the retro. There is a sweet coffee with cream and sugar essence and the cigar becomes generally sweeter. This stick is HEAVY on floral notes. Into the middle of the cigar the dynamic range expands. Notes like leather come into the equation, along with deeper floral notes, white pepper on the retrohale, semi sweet chocolate on some puffs and the florals turn fruity at times. The smoke, while still creamy, leaves a saltiness on the palate and a powdered sugar sweetness. Towards the end of the cigar the flavors really come together. There is, however a pop of cedar note and the floral fruity flavors start to become more like fermenting fruit esthers. At the very end there is a lime salt zing added in. Extremely enjoyable. I can tell there was no expense spared in the selection of these tobaccos. After all it was made for royalty, politicians, some of the wealthiest people in the world…and now, of course, Privada Cigar Club Members. #weareprivadaPairing notes: Lighter red wines like Pinot Noir, Tripel or Belgium style beer, Islay Single Malt Scotch or Highland Single Malt Scotch, Four Roses Single Barrell (not the barrel strength), cognac.

339,Kuwait Diplomat,"Tasting notes: The body of this cigar smells like a Lipton tea bag. The foot has a similar herbal sweet note but there is the addition of chocolate and the scent makes me sneeze as the foot of a cigar often does. The cold draw is more of the same: Lipton tea, dried apricot not unlike a Cuban cigar. But unlike a Cuban, it’s also peppery on the mouth and lips. The cigar starts out with a red pepper blast. Fading in are notes of fresh baked bread crusts, herbal teas, floral notes and a clean crisp white pepper on the retro. There is a sweet coffee with cream and sugar essence and the cigar becomes generally sweeter. This stick is HEAVY on floral notes. Into the middle of the cigar the dynamic range expands. Notes like leather come into the equation, along with deeper floral notes, white pepper on the retrohale, semi sweet chocolate on some puffs and the florals turn fruity at times. The smoke, while still creamy, leaves a saltiness on the palate and a powdered sugar sweetness. Towards the end of the cigar the flavors really come together.

I didn’t get all of Brian’s notes but the Tea, Herbs (Sage and Anise in my case), and Apricot, were very easy to pick out. I have a backup in my humidor, and may still add another.",5

345,The Cult Torpedo 2012 Vintage,"Tasting notes: The body of the cigar is smooth and smells of dried fig and sugary vanilla. Then I’m hit with the scent of a butterscotch hard candy like Werthers Original. The cold draw is mineraly, metallic and has slight notes of almond. The cigar starts out with a surprising amount of minerals and earth with black pepper, earl gray tea, sweet leather and an overall heat to it like an over proofed bourbon. The ground black pepper sticks around on the finish. I start to get toffee and herbs, deep dark earth with smooth sweet smoke that somehow reminds me of vanilla cake icing. I’m now tasting banana ester (esters are the odor of an organic material decomposing. Some really high proof rich spirits have ester aroma), black pepper, sweet icing smoke and minerals. Toffee, graham cracker, banana ester, herbs, grilled eggplant and earth. The black pepper turns to white pepper and some of the other flavors mend to remind me of animal crackers. Towards the end I get a lot of the above mention notes plus there is a new addition of toasted hazelnut. I really cannot believe how dynamic this smoke is. If this cigar doesn’t end the debate on if cigars should be aged no cigar will. Pairing notes: Amber lager, Pinot Grigio, vodka soda, caramel, bourbon on the rocks, flan, creme brûlée, vanilla soda or root beer, adult root beer, root beer float, jack and coke, after BBQ chicken or pulled pork.

If you have smoked a RP Twentieth in lancero, imagine that flavor with some jazz. Light pepper, barn and a funky note that only comes from fermentation. Well constructed, great burn without those pain in the nub issues many lanceros suffer from. I didnt touch up the burn once. If you know and like RPs twentieth, buy a handful of these sticks. You will love them.",4
